# Road-Accident-Analysis-Dashboard-Tableau-
Interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing road accident data to identify trends in casualties, vehicle types, weather conditions, road surfaces, and high-risk locations with year-over-year insights.

## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard built using Tableau.
The dashboard provides insights into road accidents, casualties, and fatal trends by analyzing data across multiple dimensions such as vehicle type, weather conditions, road surface, road type, and location.
The goal of this project is to help stakeholders understand key accident patterns, identify high-risk factors, and support data-driven decision making for road safety improvements.

## Objectives
- Analyze total accidents and casualties over time
- Compare current year vs previous year performance
- Identify fatal casualties by vehicle type
- Understand the impact of weather and road surface conditions
- Visualize accident locations geographically
- Highlight high-risk road types
